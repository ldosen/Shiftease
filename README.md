## Instructions
- Make sure to have python, npm, and pip installed on your machine before proceeding. I used the most recent versions of python, npm, nodejs, and pip as of 4/4/19.

**note:** any time in the instructions a npm install is performed it should be within the Shiftease/templates/static directory. 
### Installing

1. Run `npm install` in the Shiftease/templates/static/ directory. This should download and install all the required dependencies.
2. In the same directory as the previous step run the command `npm run watch` to build the front end code
3. Install flask. Type `$ pip install flask` at the command line.
4. Install Reactjs. Type `$ npm i react react-dom --save-dev` at the command line.

### Running
1. In the root directory, run the command `python run.py`
